## That New Site Smell!

The updated branding for FannyPack as [GameDevUtils.com]({{ site.baseurl }}/) is pretty much complete.

In the process, I've discovered several new tools that I would like to include in the suite.

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using one of my OSS projects, [Jaytch](http://jaytch.org/) - a bootstrap-based template and helper for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). My work is based on that of [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) by [@plusjade](https://github.com/plusjade/), but adds a metric crapton of new widgets and snippets.
